<h2>MSPACMAM recast as XGBoost</h2>
<p>The XGBoost gradient boosting model was trained on a compilation of ocean state variables to predict marine carbon fluxes. Training data included output from the MSPACMAM (Model of Sinking Particles and Cycling of Marine Aggregated Matter) (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GB007131">see Dinauer et al., 2022 for more details of the model)</a>. Due to spatial autocorrelation, block k-fold cross-validation was used to minimize overfitting. The trained model performed very well on the test set (R^2 score of 0.99), with the exception of localized model-data misfit in the surface coastal ocean.</p>
